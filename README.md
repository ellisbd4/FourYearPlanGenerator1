# Project Description
We are making a four-year plan generator. It allows college students to input majors and minors and maps out a plan that helps users graduate on time. This product solves the difficult major planning that underclassmen Vanderbilt students face. The product will clear confusion surrounding core/elective planning, and will provide users with a customizable track forward in their respective major. We plan for this project to serve the School of Engineering majors. Since many of the engineering electives overlap, manually inputting data is the best approach to gathering all the core information for each major.
